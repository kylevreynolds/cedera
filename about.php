      <p>At age 9 David McClure (owner of Cedera Landscapes,LLC) started his Landscaping career, mowing lawns!  He mowed up to 40 accounts all the way through High School and when he graduated from High School he decided he would go to college at Utah State University and study Horticulture to further his knowledge of landscaping.  He graduated with Honors from USU with his Horticulture Degree in the Spring of 2005, and that is when he started Cedera Landscapes, LLC.</p>
