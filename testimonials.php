      <h3>What Customers are saying about Cedera Landscapes...</h3>
      <p>Our experience with Cedera Landscapes has been a very favorable one. Dave (McClure) is responsive, friendly, knowledgeable and professional. We had extensive landscaping requirements with our newly constructed home and being new to the area, we had limited knowledge of our planting zone and what plants we should plant.  We asked Dave for his help and he created a beautiful landscape design, helped to educate us about what plants would work and we went from there. The implementation of his design provided for our dirt to become an attractive lawn with beautiful trees, shrubs and flowers. We now enjoy a beautifully landscaped yard that has made our house a home.</p>

	  <p>We have worked with Cedera Landscapes on several projects over the past
10years.  David has always been extremely helpful and dependable.  He is
very knowledgeable about native plants and vegetation.  He has been open to
our ideas and integrates them with his own creative touch. His work is top
notch and we would not hesitate to recommend him to you.</p>

		<p>I chose to meet wirh David from cedera landacaping after receiving a great recommendation from a coworker.  The appraisal was reasonably priced but most of all he listened to what I wanted to achieve with my yard and suggested things that would enhance what I already wanted.  Dave was fun to work with and can't wait to see what we come up with for the remaining yard.</p>

        <p>On our property we have very little water pressure and volume, but I met with Cedera Landscapes and they were able to design a sprinkler system for our sizeable lawn that works very well! We had them landscape our entire property in 2005 and we continue to have them maintain the sprinkler system and yard on a weekly basis and our landscape looks better than the day they finished it 6 yrs ago!</p>

        <p>Another testimonial: Dave, thanks for getting our yard done so quickly-it looks great! Your calls to check in with us each day were very much appreciated. You are very concientious. Thanks </p>
